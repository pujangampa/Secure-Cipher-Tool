# Secure-Cipher-Tool

The "Secure Cipher Tool" is a Python application designed to make the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption process easy and interactive for users. The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher that shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet. 

# Encryption and Decryption

Encryption: Users can input a numeric shift value (key) and the text they want to encrypt. Upon clicking the "ENCRYPT" button, the application performs Caesar cipher encryption and displays the resulting ciphertext in the "Encrypted Text" field.

Decryption: To decrypt previously encrypted text, users must provide the same shift value (key) used for encryption along with the ciphertext in the appropriate fields. Clicking the "DECRYPT" button then reveals the original plaintext in the "Decrypted Text" field.

# Getting Started

Prerequisites

Before using this Caesar cipher tool, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

Python 3.x: You need a Python 3.x interpreter to run the application.

Tkinter Library: Tkinter is the standard GUI library included with Python. Most Python installations include Tkinter by default.

# Usage

To use the Caesar Cipher Tool with Tkinter GUI, follow these steps:

Clone or Download: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Run the Script: Execute the caesar_cipher_gui.py script using Python.

Interact with the GUI: The application window opens, allowing you to interact with the Caesar cipher tool.

Encryption:

Enter a numeric shift value (key) in the "Enter The Key" field.
Input the text you want to encrypt in the "Enter The Plain Text" field.
Click the "ENCRYPT" button to encrypt the text.
Decryption:

To decrypt, enter the same shift value and the encrypted text in the respective fields.
Click the "DECRYPT" button to reveal the original plaintext.
Reset: Use the "RESET" button to clear all fields and start over.
